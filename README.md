This repository contains the implementation of IS 590DV Final project for Group 6 in Spring 2019.
The project revolves around question of how americans spend their time.
Utilizing the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and Current Population Survey (CPS) data,
we aim to surface some interesting facts about variations in time usage patterns across geography and demographics.
